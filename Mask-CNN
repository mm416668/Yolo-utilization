First, I need to configure the environment by using the command

pip install -r requirements.txt

 And then I download the whole project from git hub 

git clone https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.git

Then I need to do the set up by using the commend, and run the mask_cnn on the dog image test dataset

python setup.py install



python mask_cnn.py splash --weight=/mask_rcnn_balloon.h5 --image=/dog.jpg

The first time I got an error message that the weight file (mask_rcnn_balloon.h5) permission was denied. So, I need to authorise the weight first by using  

sudo chmod 755 'mask_rcnn_coco.h5'

Then run the program again 

 


There is an output image in the current working folder

And we check the output image

 

Seems like the model doesnâ€™t recognize the dog.

If we try the original dataset that provide by the model

 
python mask_cnn.py splash --weight=mask_rcnn_balloon.h5 --image=test.jpg
